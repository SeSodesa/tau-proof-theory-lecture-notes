These lecture notes are a \LaTeX\ version of the notes originally
written for the Tampere University course \emph{Mathematical Logic: Proof Theory}
by Esko Turunen. In the process of translating the document, an attempt has been
made to fix typos, include missing definitions and the like. Some of the added
definitions like the alternative formulation of Definition~\ref{def:rank of a proof}
might be non-standard, but even the ones that are should not be contradictory.

New errors might of course have been introduced, especially as the transpilation had to
be done by hand and not only that, it was done in a hurry.
Regardless, these notes should be a much more readable than the original notes,
and the added search functionality via \texttt{Ctrl+F} in most PDF readers
should ease the use of this document as a reference. In order to fix errors,
pull or merge requests and issues may be posted on Github or any other version
control system these notes are hosted on.

In the hopes that this document will prove useful to the reader.
