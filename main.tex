\section{What is mathematics about?}

To answer the question set in the title of this chapter, \emph{proofs}.

\begin{example}[Proof by contradiction]
The infinite set of natural numbers \(\Nset = \set{1, 2, 3, \ldots}\) should already be familiar to you.
It is closed under addition \(+\) and multiplication \(\mult\).
In other words, if \(a, b\in\Nset\), then \(a + b \in\Nset\) and \(a\mult b\in\Nset\).
But what about division \(\div\)? We know that \(6 \div 2 = 3 \in\Nset\),
but \(3\div 6 = 1 / 2 \notin\Nset\).

It is known that some natural numbers are products of two \emph{other} natural numbers,
while others are not. For example, \(6 = 2 \mult 3\) and \(20 = 4 \mult 5\),
but
\[
2 = 2\mult 1,
\quad
3 = 3\mult 1,
\quad
5 = 5 \mult 1,
\quad
7 = 7 \mult 1,
\ldots\,.
\]
\end{example}
These numbers whose factors only consist of themselves and the number \(1\) are called \emph{prime numbers}
and denoted with \(\Pset\). How many prime numbers are there? We show that there are infinitely many via
\emph{proof by contradiction}.

Before we begin, let us analyze the products of prime numbers a bit more closely:
\begin{align*}
    2 \mult 3                   &= 6,   & 6 + 1     &= 7 \in\Pset \\
    2\mult 3 \mult 5            &= 30   & 30 + 1    &= 31 \in\Pset \\
    2 \mult 3 \mult 5 \mult 7   &= 210  & 210 + 1   &= 211\in\Pset\\
                                &\vdots &           &\vdots
\end{align*}
It seems like when the number \(1\) is added to any product of primes, the resulting number is prime.
A natural seeming approach is to then make the contrapositive assumption that if \(p_i, p_n\in\Pset\),
a \emph{natural number}
\begin{equation}
b = 2\mult 3 \mult 5 \mult \cdots \mult p_i\mult\cdots \mult p_n \mult p_n + 1 = p_i\mult c \notin\Pset
\end{equation}
for some \(c\in\Nset\), then
\begin{equation*}
    \frac b {p_i} = c = \frac{2 \mult 3 \mult 5 \mult \cdots \mult p_n + 1}{p_i} \notin\Nset\,.
\end{equation*}
This is in contradiction with our assumptions, which proves that there are infinitely many primes.
